	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Giuseppe Castiglione and I’m an aspiring Front-End Web Developer.<br />The obsessive perfectionist in me ensures my work is pixel perfect, and that my code is kept clean and concise.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have an agile, yet logical approach to work which has developed over my 4 years in the industry at a small creative agency. During that time I have had to fill many roles, that often meant having to research and master new technologies fairly quickly to complete a project.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m now looking to focus and advance my knowledge as a Junior Front-End Web Developer within the London and Hertfordshire area. 
		</p>

			Please feel free to contact me with any questions.
