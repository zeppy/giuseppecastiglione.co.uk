	<p><a href="http://explanimation.net">Explanimation.net</a> Built to showcase and sell explanatory animations, "Explanimations". The Front-End was developed from the default Wordpress theme, and a bespoke post type was created for the entry, management and displaying of the animations. </p>

	<p><a href="http://glennaperry.co.uk">GlennaPerry.co.uk</a> The purpose of this project was for a Graphic Designer to promote herself and her work online. Due to the short turnaround time, we decided on developing an existing theme on social networking site Tumblr.com to suit her needs. This included creating a landing page with selected items and individual project pages, only using a tagging system.</p>

	<p><a href="http://www.archipelago.co.uk">Archipelago.co.uk</a> A place for this small, but specialised creative agency to showcase their work. The Front-End, similar to Explanimation.net, was developed from the default Wordpress theme, with bespoke post types for easy entry and management of diverse portfolio items.</p>

	<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/">Wordpress Development</a> I have developed quite a few sites using Wordpress as the CMS. During the development of these projects, it became apparent that certain content would prove difficult to enter using the basic features. To overcome this I created custom post entry pages to easily enter and manage content. This also helped keep layout consistent.</p>

	<p><a href="http://yres.co.uk">Yres.co.uk</a> This was a small side project of Explanimation.net. The client requested an interactive banner for their site which displayed the different renewable technologies. The banner uses parallax to create depth with interaction of certain elements. This was one of my first projects developing with JavaScript & jQuery.</p>
