=========================

These are the files for my personal website.
During this project I discovered that the toughtest client is myself. 

I believe in not reinventing the wheel, so the following list contains either
templates, plugins or snippets of code I used to aid me in making my site.

/process.php
/js/css3-mediaqueries.js - To enable media queries in older browsers
/js/jquery.viewport.min.js - To help with the nav scrolling
/js/respond.min.js - Enables responsive design for older browsers
/js/responsiveslides.min.js - Lightweight, responsive slider

The rest of the content was coded by myself.

If I weren't already working on a new layout for this site I would improve this site by optimizing my style.scss to a more object oriented method of coding. I would also change the way that my work examples are displayed.
