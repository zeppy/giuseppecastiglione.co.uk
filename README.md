=========================

<p>These are the files for my personal website.</p>
<p>During this project I discovered that the toughtest client is myself. </p>

<p>I believe in not reinventing the wheel, so the following list contains either
templates, plugins or snippets of code I used to aid me in making my site.</p>
<ul>
<li>/process.php
<li>/js/css3-mediaqueries.js - To enable media queries in older browsers</li>
<li>/js/jquery.viewport.min.js - To help with the nav scrolling</li>
<li>/js/respond.min.js - Enables responsive design for older browsers</li>
<li>/js/responsiveslides.min.js - Lightweight, responsive slider</li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of the content was coded by myself.</p>

<p>If I weren't already working on a new layout for this site I would improve this site by optimizing my style.scss to a more object oriented method of coding. I would also change the way that my work examples are displayed.</p>
